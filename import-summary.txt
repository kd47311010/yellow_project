ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* hiseoul-web.png
* images\
* images\2.jpg
* images\331-1.jpg
* images\DSC01398-Edit.jpg
* images\IMG_7104.jpg
* images\arbutton1.png
* images\arbutton2.png
* images\c0010538_1531878.jpg
* images\infobutton1.png
* images\infobutton2.png
* images\ntower.jpg
* images\sangmyung.jpg
* images\themebutton1.png
* images\themebutton2.png
* proguard.cfg

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => app\src\main\assets\
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\
* src\seoultour\project\team\README.txt => app\src\main\resources\seoultour\project\team\README.txt

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
